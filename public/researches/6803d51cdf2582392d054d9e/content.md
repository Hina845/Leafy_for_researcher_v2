| **Research  questions** | What are the questions your research is trying to answer? Pro tip: 5 research questions is a solid place to start. Do not include more than 7-10 research questions. |
| **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** | How can you measure progress toward the research goals?  KPIs might include: Time on task, use of navigation vs. search, user error rates, drop-off rates, conversion rates, system usability scale (SUS), etc. |
| **Methodology** | How will you collect data? How will you analyze the data once you get it?  The methodology should be detailed so that other researchers can understand what you did, the choices you made, and the limitations of the methods employed to decide if or when further research is needed.  |
| **Participants** | Who will you include in this study? What characteristics do the participants have? Why did you choose them?  Note: If you’re intentionally including specific populations (e.g., users with diverse abilities and perspectives), be clear about the needs of the study. |
| **Script** | What questions will you ask study participants? When your full script is ready, insert it here, along with some design mockups to provide context. In the meantime, add “TBD” (to be determined). |
